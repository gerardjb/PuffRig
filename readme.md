This is code for controlling a behavioral experiment using two Arduino microcontrollers with a Python based web interface. Code is run through a Raspberry pi and data about the behavior is recorded via a picamera. Trial triggering is designed to allow scanimage acquisition start triggering for 2P imaging, but this is of course not necessary. See a sample image of web-based GUI with camera output layout here:
